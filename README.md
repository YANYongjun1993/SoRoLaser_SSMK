# SSMK-MPC: Data-Driven Micromotion Control for Soft Robotic Laser Surgery  

This repository provides the implementation of an **MPC controller with a data-driven surrogate model** for dynamic micromotion control in laser surgery.  

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Surrogate Modeling**  
  Derived by adapting **Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD)** to approximate the Koopman operator on **low-dimensional Spectral Submanifold (SSM) coordinates**.  

- **Efficiency & Accuracy**  
  Captures task-relevant dynamics with high fidelity while preserving linearity for efficient **MPC implementation at 100 Hz**.  

- **Experimental Validation**  
  Demonstrated on **millimeter-scale figure-8 trajectory tracking**, where **SSMK-MPC** outperforms both SSMP and Koopman models, effectively suppressing oscillations seen in direct Koopman-based approaches.  

- **Surgical Relevance**  
  Precise micromotion control enables sharp incisions, reduced collateral thermal damage, and motion compensation for respiration and heartbeat.
